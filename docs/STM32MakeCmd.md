# MakeFile CMD -- F446RE

## 1. Make FLASH

```bash
flash: all
    @echo "Flash the STM32F446RE"
    openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg -c "program $(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET).elf verify" -c reset -c exit
```

This flashes the STM32F446RE with the .elf file generated by the make command.

## 2. Make CLEAN

```bash
clean:
	if exist $(BUILD_DIR) rmdir /s /q $(BUILD_DIR)
```

This cleans the build directory.
