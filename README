## Introduction

CubeSats are miniaturized satellites that have become increasingly popular for space exploration and scientific research due to their small size, cost-effectiveness, and modular design. This project focuses specifically on the electrical aspects of a CubeSat, excluding any mechanical components.

The key objectives of this project include:

- **Power Management:** Efficiently manage power resources to ensure the CubeSat's continuous operation in space.

- **Communication Systems:** Implement reliable communication protocols for data transmission between the CubeSat and ground control.

- **Sensor Integration:** Integrate and interface various sensors to gather data for scientific or mission-specific purposes.

- **Onboard Computer Systems:** Develop the necessary software for the CubeSat's onboard computer to execute mission tasks and handle data.

- **Fault Tolerance:** Implement mechanisms to handle errors and faults to ensure the CubeSat's robustness in harsh space environments.
